# SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Sentiment Analysis** system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model is designed to classify text data such as product reviews, tweets, or comments into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiments. This analysis helps businesses and researchers understand public opinion, feedback, and emotional tone across various platforms.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and evaluation
- **NLTK / SpaCy** – Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- **GloVe** – Pre-trained word embeddings
- **Bidirectional LSTM** – Deep learning architecture for text classification
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – For training LSTM models

##  Key Features
- Preprocessing of raw text data (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization).
- Word embedding using GloVe for capturing word context.
- Deep learning model using Bidirectional LSTM for sentiment classification.
- Visualization of sentiment trends using charts and graphs.
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

##  Visualizations
- Word clouds for frequently used terms in each sentiment class.
- Distribution plots of sentiment predictions.
- Time-series analysis of sentiment trends (if applicable).

##  Dataset
The dataset can include public reviews, social media comments (e.g., tweets), or custom feedback text. For testing and experimentation, standard datasets like IMDb Reviews or Twitter Sentiment datasets may be used.

##  How to Run
